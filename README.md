# Go by Example üöÄ

This repository provides a collection of simple, self-contained examples that demonstrate various features of the Go programming language. Each example is located in its own directory and includes a `main.go` file that can be run to see the feature in action. This project is based on the original [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com) website.

## How to Use üìñ

To run any of the examples, navigate to the corresponding directory and use the `go run` command. For example, to run the "Hello World" example:

```bash
cd hello-world
go run main.go
```
